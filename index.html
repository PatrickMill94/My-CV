    <p>
        Part II Architectural Assistant <br/>
        August 2023 - present <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Working as part of a large commercial practice, with involvement specifically in the sport and live entertainment sector.
    </p>
    <p>
        Key Project: Ibrox Stadium Accessibility Upgrades 
    </p>
    <p>
        Engaging with Rangers Football Club, the Ibrox Stadium project focused on delivering transformative accessibility upgrades, positioning the venue as one of the most 
        inclusive and accessible arenas in Europe. The design approach prioritized both enhanced functionality and seamless integration within the existing stadium architecture, 
        ensuring that all fans can experience matches in a comfortable and equitable environment. This comprehensive upgrade reinforces Ibrox Stadium’s commitment to 
        accessibility and sets a benchmark for inclusive design in sports architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project featured the installation of accessible toilet and catering facilities to accommodate all users and the construction of a covered, accessible platform for wheelchair 
        users within the seating deck. A key feature of the proposal was a cantilevered extension to the upper seating deck, adding 600 seats and showcasing innovative design. 
        This hybrid approach combined overdecking the existing terrace with new seating rows at the front, optimizing space while improving the spectator experience.
    </p>
    <p>
         The role involved working from early concept design, testing design proposals supported by thoroughly researched existing precedents. It also included developing 
        detailed design packages for Building Warrant applications, addressing warrant points in line with building regulations, coordinating with Building Control Officers, and 
        collaborating with subcontractors and consultants to gather necessary certifications and data. Responsibilities extended to producing tender packages in coordination 
        with Structural Engineers, Quantity Surveyors and subcontractors. Further coordination of Autodesk Revit models were led by me to ensure design team were aligned to 
        both existing survey information of stadium and the collaborated design proposal. In the construction stage of the project, duties involved producing construction package 
        drawings, attending site meetings, conducting snagging visits under the supervision of the Project Architect, and resolving on-site contractor queries with design solutions.
    </p>
        Key roles specific to my skill set include creating 3D models of buildings and surrounding site context on Autodesk Revit, setting up key views and producing rendered CGIs 
        using Enscape. With my strong passion for sport stadiums, extensive research into the technical guidelines and safety for this typology was critical in developing the design.
